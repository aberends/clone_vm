  # AB: since a prerequiste for some roles is that the VM is
  # "shut off", we poll the VM state to make sure it is
  # indeed "shut off". The timing is set to a maximum of 100
  # * 3s = 300s because a minimal installation can take
  # almost 300s. If it takes longer we assume something is
  # wrong and human intervention is needed.
